cppcomm: header-only cpp communications
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This repository is a personal project to create a header-only cpp communication thing.

At the time of writing (2022-03-28) I have gotten tired of the greenless state of my github page, and I want to get addicted again.
So I decided to start a project to work on consistently, but hmm, what should I do?
A specific application was out of the question because I don't have any problems to solve in my life that I can't solve with existing software.
So how about a library? I might use it in my own projects, or someone might fork it and make it into something useful.

I mostly chose to do this because my graduation thesis covered network communications and that was super fun. Go have a read if you want:

### whoami

What's cppcomm supposed to do?

I dunno, but let's just try to work on a few goals:

cppcomm should at first be able to facillitate client-server topology.

But ryyi, nobody will ever use your library! There are way better libs and 
Ok smartypants, that's how I feel too.


### design choices

I like snake_case.

I like writing C++ in C-style, but I dislike not having access to STL (fuck you C-strings)

I just wanna make my keyboard make clicky noises and write aesthetically pleasing pixels on my screen that might or might not segfault.
