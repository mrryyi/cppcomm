| TCP blocking | TBI | n/a |
| Message Wrapping | TBI | n/a |
| Thread-safe | TBI | n/a |
| Memory-safe | TBI | n/a |

Examples
--------

### UDP nonblocking

```
void main() {
// ...
const char * local_inet_address = "127.0.0.1";

cppcomm::Communicator communicator;
auto ret = communicator.init_nonblocking_udp(local_inet_address, PORT_CLIENT);
if (ret != cppcomm::SUCCESS_INIT) {
  WSACleanup();
  return 0;
}

cppcomm::Message msg;
uint32 msg_size = cppcomm::client_msg_one_write(msg.buffer);
auto ret = communicator.send_msg(msg, msg_size, server_address);

// Continues after sending without blocking

// ...
```

Background
------------

At the time of writing (2022-03-28) I have gotten tired of the greenless state of my github page, and I want to get addicted again.
So I decided to start a project to work on consistently, but hmm, what should I do?
A specific application was out of the question because I don't have any problems to solve in my life that I can't solve with existing software.
So how about a library? I might use it in my own projects, or someone might fork it and make it into something useful.

This project was chosen in particular because, had I written something like this prior to writing [Splite](https://github.com/mrryyi/Splite), I'd'n't've'd to spend approximately 50% of Splite development on pointer debugging.

Discussion
----------

### What is cppcomm supposed to do?

cppcomm should at least help facillitate client-server topology.

### Design choices

I like snake_case.

I like writing C++ in C-style, but I dislike not having access to STL.

I just wanna make my keyboard do clicky noises and produce aesthetically pleasing pixels on my screen that might or might not segfault.
